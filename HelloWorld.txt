Hello World
Working on test-branch - improved!
This is important part
Working an a test case

Learning how git fetch and git pull work
Git fetch just fetches the changes
Git pull = git fetch + git merge
Now let`s see how git fetch works
it will not merge or apply the remote changes to our local branch
I add a new Test Case
Lets see changes before merge them after git fetch
I add a new Test case for Regression
I add a new Test case for Smoke
